                <details open>

                        Branding / Logo

                        Easy! As long as you don't have to support IE11 or older browsers you could use
                        <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> natively.
                    </div>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>
                        Packaging
                    </summary>
                    <div>
                        No worries. The fallback for these elements is quite good. They will display as open. You won't
                        get the open/close mechanism, but you won't lose any content either.
                    </div>

                <details>

                        Websites
                    </summary>
                    <div>
                        Almost anything you'd like. The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element allows all <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#flow_content"
                            target="_blank">flow content</a>, which is basically everything.
